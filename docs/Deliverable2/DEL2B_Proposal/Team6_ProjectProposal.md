# - Section 1 Phenomena of interest: Description

The gaming industry has developed into an elaborate digital environment where player perception is influenced by both natural interactions and AI-powered bots that affect online discussion, engagement metrics, and 
reviews. Through metric manipulation, fake interaction, and trend amplification, these bots manipulate game popularity on sites like Steam, Reddit (subreddits), Twitch, and Discord. Bots generate a false impression
of player consensus by inflating ratings, spamming positive or negative comments, and creating fake viewership, which deceives developers and consumers alike. This manipulation is the result of several important
dynamics. By oversaturating platforms with skewed ratings, artificial review inflation and deflation affect how people evaluate games. Certain storylines are promoted via social media and forum amplification, 
which produces fabricated controversy or hype. Manipulation of viewing and fake engagement inflate numbers, which affect YouTube recommendations and Twitch rankings. To address these dangers, platform detection 
systems and anti-bot countermeasures are always evolving, while AI-powered bots adapt in response, posing an ongoing challenge.

Karataş & Şahin (2017) review different ways to detect social bots on online platforms. They explain three main methods: machine learning, network analysis, and content analysis. The paper highlights that bots are becoming more advanced and harder to detect. The authors suggest that combining multiple detection techniques, such as analyzing user behavior and content patterns, is the best approach. They also discuss new research trends, like deep learning, to improve detection methods.

Wang et al. (2019) study how to detect fake reviews in app stores. Fake reviews can trick users and affect app rankings. The authors analyze how fake reviews are written, when they are posted, and who writes them. They use machine learning to create models that identify fake reviews. Their research shows that looking at user behavior and writing style helps detect fake reviews. They suggest that using deep learning and sentiment analysis can improve accuracy.
