EECS4461 Group Project

## A. Overview
This project simulates the spread of artificial hype in online gaming communities by modeling interactions between social bots and real users. Our prototype uses a network-based approach where agents change state over time (e.g., Disruptors, Followers, Critical Thinkers). The simulation collects data and visualizes it through a dynamic network graph, a line chart, and a bar chart.

## B. How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**  
2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

solara run server.py
(If needed, use python -m solara run server.py)

The terminal will display a URL (typically http://127.0.0.1:8765). Open it in your browser, adjust the sliders, and watch the simulation in real time.


Limitations & Planned Improvements
Bot Behavior: Currently, bots only spread hype. Future improvements will add adaptive, coordinated behaviors.
Immunity: Agents that recover remain permanently immune. We plan to explore temporary immunity to better reflect real user behavior.
Parameter Exploration: We are testing a limited range of parameters. Future work will include more systematic experiments and deeper statistical analysis.
Network Structure: We currently use an Erdős–Rényi network; we may explore other network types (e.g., scale-free or small-world) to better mimic real-world social structures.
